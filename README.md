ðŸ§© Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy in Java

This repository demonstrates the difference between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java.

ðŸ“– Shallow Copy

Creates a new object but copies only the references of nested objects.

Changes in the copied object affect the original object.

ðŸ“– Deep Copy

Creates a new object along with copies of all nested objects.

Changes in the copied object do not affect the original object.
